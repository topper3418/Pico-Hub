# Pico-Hub
I am working on networking raspberry pi pico's on a local network using a pi as a hub. obviously any computer will work as the server


TODO:
( ) create a "get status" request for the LED strip
( ) clone onto a raspberry pi server
( ) have running permanently.
( ) come up with way for the pi server to "find" the pico on startup without IP being hardcoded. Possible?
( ) record latency between button click and action being taken on the strip
( ) talk directly to strip and record time difference
( ) add hue selector that overrides what white is supposed to be
( ) come up with a good object-oriented library for this
